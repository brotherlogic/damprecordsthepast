Newly 24-bit mastered from 7\" vinyl. The original concept was to include every single A and B side up to the end of 1983 on a double CD, however Voiceprint was unable to come to a satisfactory arrangement to procure the rights to the Rough Trade singles, so they had to be dropped and it ended up as a single CD.", "released_formatted": "02 Dec 2002", "identifiers": [{"type": "Barcode", "value": "604388603725"}], "genres": ["Rock"], "styles": ["Art Rock"], "tracklist": [{"position": "1", "type_": "track", "title": "Bingo Master's Breakout", "duration": "2:22"}, {"position": "2", "type_": "track", "title": "Psycho Mafia", "duration": "2:12"}, {"position": "3", "type_": "track", "title": "Repetition", "duration": "4:54"}, {"position": "4", "type_": "track", "title": "It's The New Thing", "duration": "3:25"}, {"position": "5", "type_": "track", "title": "Various Times", "duration": "5:14"}, {"position": "6", "type_": "track", "title": "Rowche Rumble", "duration": "3:59"}, {"position": "7", "type_": "track", "title": "In My Area", "duration": "4:05"}, {"position": "8", "type_": "track", "title": "Fiery Jack", "duration": "4:43"}, {"position": "9", "type_": "track", "title": "2nd Dark Age", "duration": "1:58"}, {"position": "10", "type_": "track", "title": "Psykick Dancehall N\u00ba 2", "duration": "3:34"}, {"position": "11", "type_": "track", "title": "Lie Dream Of A Casino Soul", "duration": "3:06"}, {"position": "12", "type_": "track", "title": "Fantastic Life", "duration": "5:18"}, {"position": "13", "type_": "track", "title": "Look, Know", "duration": "4:38"}, {"position": "14", "type_": "track", "title": "I'm Into C.B.", "duration": "6:28"}, {"position": "15", "type_": "track", "title": "Marquis Cha-Cha", "duration": "4:27"}, {"position": "16", "type_": "track", "title": "Room To Live", "duration": "4:12"}], "extraartists": [], "images": [{"type": "primary", "uri": "", "resource_url": "", "uri150": "", "width": 400, "height": 400}], "thumb": "", "estimated_weight": 85, "blocked_from_sale": false}
